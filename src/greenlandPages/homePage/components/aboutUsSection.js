It's hard and thus most food seekers end up giving up on their search for quality produce, which we know feels like shit. Every time I tried to seek good quality produce, I ended up being frustrated by the amount of time and effort it took to filter through the noise and land on fine cereals or vegetables. I had to work around different regions, with different vendors selling at prices almost touching the sky. I knew there was a problem. On my quest, I happened to speak to farmers who complained on end about how brokers took advantage of them,  buying their produce at throw price only to sell it at exaggerated prices to the end consumer."
